[/INST] Place long-grain glutinous rice and purple rice in a large bowl and cover by 2 inches of cool water. Using your hands, vigorously swish rice until water turns cloudy, about 30 seconds. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain rice, discarding the cloudy soaking water. Refill bowl with cool water and repeat rinsing and draining process until water runs clear. Return washed rice to large bowl and cover with room temperature water. Soak rice, uncovered, for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours in the refrigerator. Using a fine-mesh strainer, drain rice. Line a bamboo steamer with wet cheesecloth. Transfer rice to cheesecloth-lined bamboo steamer and spread in an even layer. Using your finger, poke evenly spaced holes into the rice mound; this will help the rice cook uniformly. Fold the flaps of the cheesecloth over the rice, and cover. (Cheesecloth doesn’t have to fully cover rice; the folding ensures the flaps don’t sit in the water. See notes for instructions on preparing the rice if you don’t have a bamboo steamer.) Fill a large wok with 2 inches (5 cm) water, and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Cover bamboo steamer basket and lower it into the wok. Steam until rice is al dente and shiny, about 30 minutes, replenishing the bottom of the wok with boiling water if needed. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Rinse the pickled mustard greens under cold running water. Squeeze out excess water, and pat dry with paper towels. Mince and set aside for later. Cut the crullers in half lengthwise and toast in the oven on a 9- by 13- inch rimmed baking sheet until dark golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. (They should be very crispy but not burnt.) In a medium nonstick pan, heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil over low until just shimmering. Add the minced pickled mustard greens, diced bean curd, and sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until sugar has dissolved and the greens are withered and dried out, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside for later. In a small bowl, whisk eggs, salt, and 1 tablespoon water until smooth. Using a fine-mesh sieve, strain mixture into a clean bowl. In a medium nonstick skillet, add remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil over medium-low heat until just shimmering. When the pan is hot, pour in egg mixture and tilt pan so the egg forms a thin and even film. Immediately cover the pan with a lid and cook until eggs are set, about 1 minute. Turn off heat, and wait until egg completely solidifies, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Remove lid and, when egg is cool enough to handle, use your fingers or chopsticks gently peel it off the frying pan and place it on a cutting board. Roll egg up tightly, and cut it crosswise into 1/4 inch- (6 mm–) thick strips. To Assemble: Fold a clean kitchen towel so it forms a rectangle roughly 7 inches by 6 inches (18 cm by 15 cm). Arrange towel on kitchen counter with the long sides parallel to the counter edge.  Cover towel completely with plastic wrap. Dip a spoon in water and use it to spread about  1/4 (about 6 ounces; 170g) of the cooked rice evenly across plastic wrap, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. The long side of the rectangle should still be facing you. Sprinkle a line of the egg strips down the length of the rice rectangle, add the diced bean curd and mustard greens on top, and then finally a chunk of the fried cruller lined up vertically on top of everything. Lift up towel and plastic wrap to roll rice over the filling, using your hands to gently squeeze and shape the sticky rice into an oblong rice roll. Repeat for remaining rice rolls. Take it to go, or unwrap the plastic and enjoy immediately.

[/INST] For the Cake: Grease a 13-by-9-inch metal baking pan with cooking spray. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and lemon zest, if using. In a liquid measuring cup, whisk together warm milk and egg. Start mixer on low speed and slowly pour in milk mixture in steady stream. Mix, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until dough is uniform and no dry flour remains, 2 to 3 minutes. Increase mixer speed to medium. With mixer running, add softened butter 1 piece at a time, mixing to incorporate after each addition. Continue to knead until dough is stretchy and webby, about 8 minutes longer (dough will be soft and sticky). Using a greased dough scraper or rubber spatula, transfer dough to prepared baking pan. Lightly grease your hands and press and stretch dough into an even layer to fill the edges of pan. Cover pan tightly with a kitchen towel or greased plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until slightly puffy, 45 minutes to 1 hour. For the Crumb Topping: Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (275°C). Clean and dry stand mixer bowl and fit stand mixer with paddle attachment. In mixer bowl, combine softened butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and cinnamon. Cream together on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Stop mixer and using a rubber spatula, scrape down sides of bowl. Start mixer on medium-low speed and add flour, a few tablespoons at a time, until incorporated and mixture forms clumps with the texture of soft cookie dough. Scrape dough from paddle, cover bowl, and let sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes. When dough is ready, remove plastic wrap. If dough has shrunk away from sides of pan, gently stretch it back into edges. Use your hands to squeeze and compress crumb topping into large chunks, then break into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces and scatter evenly over dough in pan. (It will seem like way too much, but it’s not!) Using flat hands, gently press crumb layer into surface of cake. Bake until crumb topping begins to turn light golden brown and wooden skewer inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.

Add shortening and, using your hands, rub shortening into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs and no large pieces of shortening remain; set aside. For the Filling: Add baking soda to a spouted 2-cup heat-proof measuring cup. Pour hot water over baking soda and allow soda to dissolve, about 10 seconds. Add molasses and whisk vigorously until molasses dissolves and liquid is foamy and bubbly, about 30 seconds. Add egg yolk and whisk well to thoroughly combine, about 10 seconds more. (The filling will be very liquid with foam on the surface.) Set prepared pie plate on rimmed baking sheet. Pour filling over crust. Scatter topping evenly over pie filling to cover completely. (Distribute slightly more of the mixture around the outside edge; this stops the filling from bubbling over the crust and prevents a dry, sunken spot from forming in the middle.) Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake until crust and topping are golden brown and the center no longer jiggles, 30 to 35 minutes more.

Repeat with remaining eggs, evenly spacing the remaining 7 eggs in total around the skillet (7 around perimeter and 1 in the center). Season each egg lightly with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, cover, and cook, reducing heat as needed to maintain gentle simmer, until yolks film over, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, covered, until whites are just set (if skillet is shaken lightly, each egg should jiggle), 1 to 2 minutes longer for slightly runny yolks or 3 to 4 minutes for soft-cooked yolks. Off heat sprinkle with Parmesan and chopped basil and drizzle with extra oil. Serve immediately with toasted bread. 12-inch skillet Adjust the red pepper flakes amount to your preferred spice level. The sauce can be cooked through step 3 and refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. </s> <s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are an expert chef who provides step-by-step recipes.

[/INST] For the Danish Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together warm water and the 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in yeast until well-combined; let stand, uncovered, at room temperature until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together bread flour, salt, and remaining 6 tablespoons granulated sugar on low speed until combined, about 15 seconds. Add egg and 85g (6 tablespoons) butter; pulse mixer between low speed and off until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 170g (12 tablespoons) butter; pulse mixer between low speed and off until butter is coated with flour, about 10 seconds. Stir cold milk into yeast mixture, then slowly add yeast mixture while pulsing mixer between low speed and off, until a shaggy dough forms, about 2 minutes. (There will be pieces of dough that have formed together, but it will not be a smooth or homogeneous dough.) Using a silicone spatula or a dough scraper, scrape dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently shape into a 7-inch square about 1 1/4-inch thick; the dough will be slightly sticky. Tightly wrap in plastic wrap; freeze until chilled, about 30 minutes. On a lightly floured work surface, roll dough into a 18- by 9-inch rectangle (1/4-inch thick), with the long sides parallel to the counter edge. Fold the dough like a business letter: Fold dough into thirds (each section should be 6-inches wide) like a letter by bringing the right third over the center, then folding the left third over to create a smaller rectangle. (Use a bench scraper or the flat side of a chef’s knife to lift dough if necessary.) Transfer to a lightly floured 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes. Repeat rolling, folding, and chilling process 2 more times for a total of 3 folds. After the final fold, refrigerate dough for 1 hour 30 minutes or overnight. For the Cream Cheese Frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together cream cheese, egg yolk, powdered sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Using a silicone spatula, transfer the frosting to a pastry bag and secure the top with kitchen twine, a rubber band, or a chip clip; set aside at room temperature. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a roughly 13-inch square (1/4-inch thick). Using a sharp chef’s knife or pizza cutter, trim edges into a 12-inch square; cut into nine 4-inch squares. Working with 1 square at a time, brush each corner of the square with beaten egg. Fold each corner into the center of the square (all corners should touch in the center) and press down gently to seal. Repeat with the 8 remaining squares of dough. Transfer to prepared baking sheets, placing each square 2 to 3 inches apart. To Bake the Pastries: Cut tip off the pastry bag to form a 1/2-inch hole. Gently press down in the center of the dough squares to create a small indentation; pipe the frosting in the center (about 2 tablespoons each; it’s okay if the mound of filling is taller than the dough.) Loosely cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm draft-free area (75°F or 24°C) until slightly puffed, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 425°F (220ºC) with racks in upper third and lower third positions. Remove and discard plastic wrap. Gently brush tops and sides of dough with beaten egg. (For best results, try not to get egg wash on the cut edges of the dough.) Bake until puffed and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Rotate baking sheets from top to bottom; reduce oven temperature to 375°F (with baking sheets in oven), and bake at 375°F until Danishes are puffed and deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. (Keep a close eye during the last few minutes of baking; 1 tray may be ready before the other). Let cool slightly on baking sheets for 15 minutes. Garnish with additional powdered sugar; serve warm or at room temperature.

Drain mackerel and carefully remove any remaining fish bones. Cut or tear mackerel into bite-sized pieces (about 1-inch). Set aside. In a Dutch oven, melt coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add onion, tomatoes, scallions, and garlic, then stir in fresh or canned coconut milk. Add Scotch bonnet, allspice berries, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain simmer, adjusting heat as needed, and cook until coconut milk has reduced to a creamy, custardy texture, about 10 minutes. This is called rundown sauce. Stir torn mackerel into rundown sauce and cook over medium heat until liquid is further reduced and fish, vegetables, and rundown sauce are combined in a thick and creamy stew, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, for the Boiled Green Bananas (Optional): Fill a large bowl with cold water. Using gloved hands, cut ends off green bananas. Then, using a paring knife and working with one banana at a time, make a lengthwise slit into the skin from top to bottom. Remove skin from banana, then, scrape away any stringy bits from the banana. Transfer to a large bowl of water and repeat with remaining bananas. In a large pot of salted boiling water, boil bananas until fork-tender, about 20 minutes (cooking time will vary depending on the size of the bananas).

Let soak at room temperature for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour (this short soaking time helps loosen the skins without overly softening the peas). Drain soaked peas, then transfer to a countertop blender or food processor along with 1 quart (945ml) water. Pulse to slightly break up peas, about ten 1-second pulses. Pour into a medium bowl and let stand at room temperature for up to 30 minutes (skins will float to top as they separate from the peas). Set a colander over a large bowl. Slowly pour soaking water into the colander while using a free hand to keep the peas in the soaking bowl; the goal is to pour off as many of the floating skins as possible while leaving the peas behind. Pick out any peas that landed in the colander and return them to the bowl, then discard skins and soaking water. Cover peas with water, and repeat process until peas are nearly free of skins (you may need to gently massage the peas with your hands to separate any stubborn skins). Transfer skinned peas to a clean colander, rinse under cool running water, then return to medium bowl. Add fresh water to cover and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes (this will further soften the peas for blending). Drain peas, then transfer to a countertop blender or food processor. Add 1/2 cup (120ml) water, onion, chile pepper, and salt.

You will need to stir more frequently toward the end of the cooking process. Skip to step 4.For a Pressure Cooker: Place broth, 1 cup (240 ml) water, chicken (or lamb or beef), farro, and salt in a pressure cooker. Seal and bring to high pressure over medium-high heat, if using a stovetop model, or by setting to pressure-cooker mode on an electric multi-cooker. Cook at high pressure for 40 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain high pressure (if using a stovetop pressure cooker; electric ones will automatically regulate the heat and pressure level).

Set bowl onto stand mixer and, using a dough hook, mix on low speed until liquids are absorbed and no dry flour remains, about 3 minutes. Tim Chin Increase speed to medium-low and mix until butter is fully incorporated and dough starts to clear sides of bowl, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer dough to a bare work surface, knead for 30 seconds, and shape into a 9-inch log. Press log flat to 3/4-inch thickness. Wrap log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. Tim Chin To shape the dough and prepare for frying: Remove dough from refrigerator and bring to room temperature, somewhere between 68° (20°C) and 72°F (22°C), around 2 to 3 hours. Unwrap dough and transfer to a well-floured work surface. Roll dough into a 10-inch by 6-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or bench knife, divide dough into ten 1-inch by 6-inch strips. Cover dough loosely with a damp paper towel. Tim Chin Working with one strip at a time, cut in half crosswise to form two 3-inch strips. Brush the unfloured top side of one 3-inch strip lightly with water, then layer the second 3-inch strip, unfloured side down, directly on top. Lay a chopstick lengthwise along the middle of the layered dough strip and press firmly to seal the strips together and form a groove. Repeat with remaining strips of dough and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let dough strips rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it registers 400°F (204°C) on an instant-read thermometer; adjust heat as necessary to maintain this frying temperature. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, and have a spider or chopsticks and salt (and/or other seasonings) nearby.

[/INST] For the Frosting: Combine cream cheese and vanilla with half the powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then sprinkle in the rest of the sugar a little at a time. Once it is incorporated, increase to medium and beat until creamy and pale ivory, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a zip-top bag or disposable pastry bag and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. (If your kitchen is chilly and the frosting hardens in that time, briefly microwave the bag to restore its creamy texture before use.) For the Filling: Prepare filling with the same bowl and beater, mixing butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt on low speed until moistened. Increase to medium and beat the dark paste until creamy, light in color, and very soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a zip-top bag or disposable pastry bag and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. Reserve the pecans until it's time to fill and shape the rolls. For the Dough: Wipe the bowl with a paper towel, then whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and baking soda until thoroughly combined. Melt butter in a 2-quart saucier over low heat, then stir in milk and yogurt, warming to about 80°F (27°C). Add to flour and stir to form a very dry and shaggy dough. With the hook attachment, knead on low until silky-smooth and elastic, able to be gently stretched into a thin but rough sheet without tearing, about 20 minutes. First Rise: Cover bowl with plastic and set dough to rise until puffy, light, and doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes at roughly 70°F (21°C). If the dough feels dense, firm, or overly resilient, rest 15 minutes before testing again (this is more likely in chilly months). Shaping: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface, dust with flour, and roll into a 13-inch square. Snip a corner from the bag of cinnamon filling, squeeze over the dough, and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Sprinkle pecans on top and roll to form a 12-inch log, ending seam side down. Slide an 8-inch strand of thread, unflavored dental floss, or butcher's twine under the dough until you reach the middle. Cross the ends over the top and pull tight to divide the log in two. Cut each half into six 1-inch slices and arrange in a parchment-lined 9- by 13- by 2-inch aluminum baking pan (or two 8-inch by 3-inch round cake pans). Second Rise: Cover rolls with foil and refrigerate overnight, or up to 48 hours. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C); meanwhile, let cinnamon rolls stand at room temperature until oven is hot. To Bake and Serve: Bake, covered, until cinnamon rolls are puffed and firm but pale, about 45 minutes. (If using darker pans, check on the cinnamon rolls after 30 minutes.) Remove the foil and continue baking until lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Snip a corner from the bag of frosting, squeeze over the cinnamon rolls, and spread into an even layer with the back of a spoon.

[/INST] In a small bowl and using chopsticks, beat eggs until well combined and no visible traces of whites remain. Beat in the cooled dashi, mirin, and soy sauce. Preheat tamagoyaki pan over medium-high heat until you can feel moderate heat radiating off it when your hand is held an inch or two from the surface (you want it just hot enough that the eggs will gently bubble and sizzle when they hit the pan, but not so hot that they rapidly brown). Holding your greased paper towel between a pair of chopsticks, rub the pan all over with a light coating of oil, including in all the corners (it helps to store the oiled towel nearby in a small dish during the cooking process). Add 1/4 of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan to spread the egg around in an even layer covering the bottom of the pan. Using your chopsticks, puncture any large bubbles that form. When the egg has fully set on the bottom but is still slightly wet on top, begin your first roll: Lift the pan off the heat and try to slide one of your chopsticks under the far edge of the egg layer; then, with a quick upward motion of the pan, lift and roll the egg sheet up and over itself so that it rolls partway toward the handle. Repeat, rolling the egg sheet up fully toward the handle. This is the most difficult layer to roll because the egg sheet is so floppy; if you have trouble, don't worry, just use your chopsticks to push the egg sheet, bunching it up by the handle end. Return the pan to the heat. Rub the oiled towel all over the exposed surface of the pan (this should be the middle and far side), then slide the omelette roll away from the handle to the far side of the pan and grease the area near the handle. Add the next quarter of the egg mixture (you will make four layers in total), spreading it around the bottom of the pan. Using your chopsticks, lift the rolled portion up and let the raw egg run underneath it. Continue to cook, popping any large bubbles that form, until the new layer is just set and still wet on top. Now repeat the rolling step as before, sliding a chopstick under the far edge and flopping the cooked egg log over itself as you roll it toward the handle. Repeat the layering and rolling process 2 more times until the egg is finished. Turn the rolled tamagoyaki out onto a bamboo sushi mat, if desired, and roll it up tightly but gently (this helps set a uniform rolled shape, but isn't required); let stand 3 minutes. Transfer tamagoyaki to a serving plate, slice crosswise if desired, and serve with a small mound of grated daikon radish; lightly drizzle some extra usukuchi soy sauce on the daikon mound, if desired.

Set oven rack in lowest position. Grease interior of a 48-ounce ramekin with softened butter. Add some grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, rotating ramekin all around so cheese sticks to every part of buttered surface; add more cheese if you don't have enough or discard any excess. Wipe rim of soufflé dish and transfer prepared ramekin to the refrigerator until ready to use. In a small saucepan, melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat (do not allow it to brown). Add flour and whisk to form paste. Continue to cook, stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, add milk in thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of pan to maintain a lump-free texture. Sauce will initially become very thick, then get thin once all the milk is added. Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring and scraping the sides and bottom of pan, until sauce is nicely thickened, about 3 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper. Transfer béchamel sauce to a large heatproof mixing bowl and allow to cool slightly. Whisk Dijon mustard (if using) and cayenne or hot sauce (if using) into béchamel. Then, while whisking constantly, work in egg yolks one at a time until thoroughly blended. Set soufflé base aside. In a large mixing bowl, using a French whisk, electric hand blender, or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, combine egg whites with cream of tartar (if using) and beat until firm, glossy peaks form. Add 1/3 of beaten egg whites to béchamel base and stir well until whites are thoroughly combined and soufflé base has a looser consistency. Mix in Gruyère. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold remaining beaten egg whites into soufflé base until just combined. Remove soufflé dish from refrigerator and set on rimmed baking sheet. Scrape soufflé batter into prepared baking dish, filling it up to the inner ridge, not to the top (discard any excess). If desired, using an offset or other spatula, gently smooth and level surface of the soufflé batter. Transfer soufflé to oven and bake until well risen and nicely browned on top, about 30 minutes at 400°F (200°C) for less set and 35 minutes at 400°F for more set, and 35-40 minutes at 375°F (190°C) for fully set. Immediately transfer soufflé to table and serve before it deflates too much, scooping out portions onto each diner's plate. 48-ounce ramekin; French whisk, hand mixer, or stand mixer If desired, you can decrease the flour to 3 tablespoons (24g) for a slightly thinner béchamel sauce and a slightly lighter, but less sturdy, soufflé.

Cream of tartar is not required, but it can help prevent accidentally overbeating the egg whites; if you have it, you might as well add it. </s> <s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are an expert chef who provides step-by-step recipes.

It should be almond- or cigar-shaped, with the seam on bottom; if it's not, lay a clean kitchen towel over it and use your hands to adjust its shape and position, then remove towel. Serve. (To make another omelette, wipe any eggy bits out of skillet and repeat.) 8-inch nonstick skillet (see notes), disposable plastic or reusable wooden fork The single most important thing when making an omelette is to have a skillet with a perfectly nonstick surface. (Which is why we don't recommend investing in expensive nonstick cookware—it needs to be replaced too often, no matter the quality of the build.) Even pans with no visible damage, once used enough, start to lose their nonstick efficacy. Therefore, for flawless results, make sure you're using a pan in mint condition. It doesn't need to be expensive; even a cheap aluminum nonstick skillet will do. </s> <s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are an expert chef who provides step-by-step recipes.

[/INST] Line a 10 1/2– by 5 1/2–inch loaf pan with a 9- by 13-inch sheet of parchment paper, or two 9- by 5-inch loaf pans with 7- by 13-inch sheets of parchment paper. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F. Peel bananas (for roughly 12 ounces or 340g fruit) and mash with Greek yogurt, eggs, and vanilla in a medium bowl. If bananas are underripe, cover bowl with plastic and let mixture stand 30 minutes. Combine flour, sugar, oat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and coconut oil in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low until coconut oil disappears into a mealy powder. Add banana mash and continue mixing only until the floury bits disappear. Fold in nuts with a flexible spatula, scrape into prepared pan(s), and spread into an even layer. Bake until well risen and golden brown, or to an internal temperature of around 206°F (97°C), about 70 minutes for a large loaf or 45 for small. Wrapped tightly in foil, banana bread will keep up to 3 days at room temperature or 1 week in the fridge. Serve with Banana Whipped Cream, if desired. For Banana Nut Muffins: Divide batter evenly among 12 lightly greased nonstick muffin cups, adding approximately 1/2 cup (4 ounces; 120g) to each cup.
