Using your hands, mix the ingredients into a uniform dough. To test the masa, roll it into a small ball and gently crush it between your palms. If it sticks to your hands, add another tablespoon of masa harina. Once the masa is smooth and pliable, roll it into 6 uniformly sized balls. To form the sopes, place 1 masa ball on a work surface and flatten it into a pancake. Then, fold the outer 1-inch edge of the dough and pinch to create a 1-inch tall border that stands straight up. Using the tips of your fingers, press the inside of the shaped sopes base into an even thickness. In a large skillet or wok, heat oil over medium-high heat to 350\u2109 (175\u00b0C).

Cover beans with at least 1 inch of fresh water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a steady simmer and cook until beans are completely tender but still whole, about 4 hours (see notes). Meanwhile, pour boiling water into a large, heatproof mixing bowl, making sure boiling water touches most of the inner surface to sanitize it, then drain. Drain beans and transfer to the large mixing bowl. Discard the cooking liquid. If Using a Pressure Cooker: Rinse soaked beans thoroughly in 3 changes of fresh water. Cover beans with at least 1 inch of fresh water. Seal the pressure cooker lid. Bring to high pressure and cook for 10 minutes. Allow pressure to release naturally.

Meanwhile, boil a stainless steel teaspoon, a stainless steel soup spoon, and a small metal bowl in water for 5 minutes; transfer sterilized utensils to a clean work surface. Pour boiling water into the containers you will use to ferment the soybeans, then drain. In the sterilized small bowl and using the sterilized teaspoon, mix the natto starter spores with 1 tablespoon of water and immediately add to the hot soybeans (the soybeans must be hot, as this bacteria is activated by the heat). Using the sterilized soup spoon, mix soybeans very thoroughly to ensure the starter is evenly distributed throughout. Divide beans into the sanitized wide airtight containers (each container of beans should have a layer of beans no more than 2cm deep). Cover with cheesecloth and seal with the lid. Set the containers in a warm place; you can use a yogurt maker, a proofing drawer, or a turned-off oven with the oven light on; the important thing is that your beans are in an environment of about 100\u00baF (38\u00baC). Let stand, rotating the container positions after about 12 hours and checking every hour starting around the 20th hour, until the beans are covered all over in a thin white film and smell cheesy and nutty, 20 to 24 hours; see notes for more on what to do if your soybeans don't look and smell like this.

For One Tacu Tacu Cake: In a small bowl, stir together beans with their creamy cooking liquid and rice; how much rice you add will depend on how thick the bean cooking liquid has become (the thicker it is, the less rice you will need to thicken it) and personal preference. In an 8- or 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add rice-and-bean mixture, press into a flat, round shape, and cook, using a spatula to press and pack the mixture into a thick disc shape, until tacu tacu is browned on first side, about 6 minutes. Flip tacu tacu (either by inverting a plate over the skillet, flipping the tacu tacu onto the plate, and the sliding it back into the skillet, or by launching it into the air and catching it back in the skillet, if you're confident in your flipping skills).

Working with one just-warmed tortilla at a time, lay tortilla on a work surface. Spread half the refried beans on center of tortilla, leaving about 2 inches of border on either side and 3 inches of border above and below. Top with 1 tablespoon (15g) crema and 2 tablespoons (30g) guacamole, spreading each in a thin, even layer on top of the refried beans. Pile half the eggs and cheese on top. Douse with as much hot sauce as you want. Fold the tortilla sides in over the filling. Then roll the bottom flap of tortilla up over the filling, holding the sides tight as you roll. Continue rolling until the burrito is sealed. Repeat with remaining tortilla and filling ingredients. Serve right away. Medium cast iron skillet, medium nonstick skillet The burrito is best prepared shortly before serving, though the refried beans can be prepared up to three days in advance and the guacamole can be prepared a few hours in advance and refrigerated until ready to use; make sure to press plastic wrap directly against the surface of the guacamole to prevent oxidation, and reheat the refrieds before using. </s> <s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are an expert chef who provides step-by-step recipes.

[/INST] In a large straight-sided saut\u00e9 pan or skillet, combine olive oil, garlic, and anchovies (if using). Cook over medium-low heat, stirring and breaking up anchovies occasionally with a wooden spoon, until anchovies have dissolved and garlic has softened and is just beginning to turn lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Add red pepper flakes and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase heat to medium-high and add wine. Bring to a simmer and cook, swirling pan and scraping up any stuck-on bits with a wooden spoon, until wine has emulsified with olive oil and mixture is slightly reduced, about 30 seconds. Add beans and bean cooking liquid (if using cooked dry beans) or stock (if using canned beans), and, using a wooden spoon, crush roughly one-quarter of the beans against the sides and bottom of pan. Stir well, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until bean mixture is thickened to a creamy, saucy consistency, 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until softened on the exterior, but well shy of al dente and still uncooked in the center (about 3 minutes less than the package directions). Right before the pasta reaches this level of doneness, add the kale to the pan with the beans. Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer pasta to pan with beans and kale along with 1 cup (240ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 2 cups (475ml) pasta cooking water. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, 2 to 3 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed. At this point, the sauce should coat the pasta but still be loose enough to pool around the edges of the pan; because of the starch in the beans and pasta water, the sauce will continue to tighten up in the time it takes to plate and serve, so make sure it's a little looser than you would normally serve a sauce. Remove from heat, add 3/4 of grated cheese, and stir rapidly to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, passing remaining grated cheese at the table.

Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread batter evenly. Bake the casserole for 20 to 25 minutes, until the cornbread topping is light golden brown and no longer jiggles. A tester inserted into the middle of the cornbread should come out dry. Serve hot. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. This casserole can be frozen. </s> <s>[INST] <<SYS>> You are an expert chef who provides step-by-step recipes.

[/INST] For the Fatteh: In a large bowl, cover chickpeas with 6 cups (1.4L) cold water. Let stand at room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse chickpeas thoroughly. In a 6- to 8-quart Dutch oven or saucepan, combine chickpeas and cumin. Add enough water to cover by 2 inches (about 8 cups; about 1.9L) and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover with lid slightly ajar, and cook until chickpeas are completely tender but not falling apart, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Check on chickpeas, stirring occasionally, and top off with more water if needed; chickpeas should be fully submerged at all times. (See notes if using canned chickpeas.) Meanwhile: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350\u00baF (175\u00baC). Place sliced pita on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to oven. Toast, using a spoon or spatula to turn pita occasionally, until squares are completely dry and crisp and starting to darken in color, about 15 minutes. Remove and set aside until ready to use. In a medium bowl, stir tahini, garlic, salt, yogurt, and lemon juice together until smooth; the sauce should be thick and sticky. When chickpeas are done, add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of chickpea cooking liquid to bowl with tahini mixture and whisk well to incorporate. The sauce should have a consistency similar to maple syrup: thick but easily pourable. Set aside until ready to assemble. For the Lemon Dressing: In a small bowl, combine garlic, green chile, lemon juice, and extra-virgin olive oil. Whisk well to combine and season to taste with salt. Set aside. For the Meat: n a 10-inch skillet, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat until butter has melted. Add pine nuts and toast until light golden brown and fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, immediately strain nuts over a small bowl and transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Set aside. Return fat to pan. Increase heat to medium-high and add lamb or beef and season with spices and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until meat is nicely browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt. To Assemble: Arrange toasted pita on a large, deep serving platter and spoon half of the lemon dressing on top of the pita. Using a ladle, scoop chickpeas, along with about 1/2 cup of their cooking liquid, over the bread, reserving 2 tablespoons of chickpeas to garnish with. (You want the bread to soak up the liquid but not become a mushy mess.) Pour the tahini and yogurt mixture evenly over the chickpeas. Top with the fried meat and pine nuts. Garnish with the reserved chickpeas, chopped parsley, and pomegranate seeds, if using. Drizzle the remaining lemon dressing over and top with more olive oil if desired. Serve warm. Rimmed baking sheet, 6- to 8-quart Dutch oven or stockpot, whisk, 10-inch skillet Two 14-ounce cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed well, can be substituted for dried chickpeas. In a medium (4 - 6 qt) pot, cover chickpeas generously with water and add cumin. Bring to a simmer over medium heat until beans are heated through. Maintain a low simmer until you finish prepping the rest of the dish. Lebanese 7 Spice or baharat can be purchased at Arabic grocery stores or online. 1 teaspoon Lebanese 7 Spice or baharat can be substituted with 1/4 teaspoon each of ground allspice, ground cumin, ground black pepper, and ground cinnamon.

Place baking sheet with rack and beef in oven and roast until internal temperature registers 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C) on an instant-read thermometer at the thickest point, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Just before the roast comes out of the oven, add oil to a 12-inch stainless steel, or cast iron, or carbon steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add roast to skillet and cook, using tongs and moving roast as needed, until roast is evenly browned on all sides, and internal temperature registers 125\u00b0F (50\u00b0C), 5 to 7 minutes.
